Task 1: sign up for GitHub. 
Create a personal repository. 
Commit a file. Pull the file. 
Change stuff. Commit again. 
Check that you have a profile image set here. 
If you do not have a blog, start one on blogspot, WordPress, medium or anywhere else you want. 
After all is complete, add this icon to your status here: :hatching_chick: by the time we start, all those without the above will not start with us.
Then submit it to post link to the same channel #annoucement.
