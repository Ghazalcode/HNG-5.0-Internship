If you will be participating in the machine learning part of this internship (very optional), 
you will need the Anaconda distribution available here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/. 
This install is over 2gb large, so you may want to start downloading it now. Machine Learning is very hard. 
Do not attempt it if you are not already a developer, as you will just be wasting data. 
But if you know you are up for it, then please already set up your python environment with Anaconda. 
Also, please use VSCode, we will use that to make things easy. 
You can also collaborate with others to get the dependencies. E
xpect to download over 10gb of stuff to really do ML.
