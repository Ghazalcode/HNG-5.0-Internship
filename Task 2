Task 2: Join the #design-stage1 channel. 
Use Figma to design yourself a home page. 
Your page must follow a particular format: Your picture on the top left corner. 
Links below your picture About, Blog, Projects. 
Below that are three icons with links to your social media. On the right (separated by a line from the left section), will be some welcoming information for you. 
*Everyone* will need to do this. 
The mentors will give you feedback on your design, however, I will be the final judge. 
Till your design is accepted, you cannot start the internship. 
Pay attention to alignment, colors and other important parts of design.
